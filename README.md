# Personal Health Knowledge Graph
This repository contains the source code for the automatic generation and population of the Personal Health Knowledge Graph.

Using an extended version of a time-series summarization (TSS) framework (https://github.com/harrij15/TemporalSummaries) to automatically populate a personal health knowledge graph (PHKG) with relevant behavioral insights. By achieving this, we are in a position to develop a logical reasoner within a personal health ontology (PHO) that has the ability to provide performance evaluations against selected lifestyle management guidelines defined by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) (https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20-S005), as well as recommendations to (pre-)diabetics on healthier behaviors and eating habits.
